    <p>Our daughter, who is nearly two, loves books. She adores reading about monkeys, bunnies, Bluey and a host of other wholesome stories. </p><p>One of my personal favourites is Tomorrow I&#039;ll Be Brave by Jessica Hische. It&#039;s a beautifully written and illustrated book that emphasises self-affirmation. One page reads; tomorrow, I&#039;ll be strong. I&#039;ll climb and jump and run.</p><p><img src="/assets/C0D772A4-A116-453D-8071-2E32D1CCDC3A.jpeg" alt=""></p><p>Rachel and I often speak these and other affirmations over our daughter. &quot;How was your day today? I think you were really brave, made good decisions, were kind and creative today.&quot;</p><p>This shouldn&#039;t just be something we speak over children; it&#039;s important that we have people in our corner through life.</p><p>Last year through the pandemic, I was fortunate enough to have a group of business owners and family cheering us on. At the end of a long and challenging day, sometimes all you need is a, &#039;You&#039;re doing great.</p><p>It&#039;s incredible how a few kind words can transform someone&#039;s day, week or month.</p><p>So, do this more often with your teams, friends, family and strangers.</p><p>Let&#039;s call out the good stuff.</p>
