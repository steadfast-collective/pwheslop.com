<div class="prose">
    <p>If you didn&#039;t already know, I&#039;m a lapsed runner. </p><p>I believe that running is the rawest, most basic, level of sport. You don&#039;t really need specialised equipment or teammates, you just find some motivation and to move your legs. </p><p>That being said, I&#039;m not a great runner. I have however put myself through a few running challenges that required training. </p><p>Back in 2018, I ran three half marathons over three weekends. While I didn&#039;t run them quickly, it was the fittest I&#039;ve ever been.</p><p><img src="/assets/e5575a2a-93fc-4792-a8bb-0d76a900701c-1625655035.JPG" alt=""></p><p>A few weeks before the first race, I undertook a 20km around Southampton. I only set out to run 10km, but I hit my stride and everything was going great. In fact, if it wasn&#039;t for a lunch date I was already late for, I could have run 30km. </p><p>As I look back over the last 6 years running Steadfast Collective, I see two parallels to running:</p><p>1) Training matters</p><p>As each year passes, I feel more equipped and confident in my own ability. Not only from the business-experience side but also emotionally ready for any challenges or adversity.</p><p>2) Pacing matters</p><p>As with most things in life, it&#039;s easy to compare your business with others. You need to run your own race. Find a pace that works for you and run with it. </p><p>When I was somewhat fitter than I am now, I never found running a long-distance an issue. However, if I was to run with a friend and their pace was even marginally faster than mine, it instantly became a struggle. </p><p>At Steadfast Collective, I would rather run the distance at my own pace than be sprinting and burn out, again.</p>
