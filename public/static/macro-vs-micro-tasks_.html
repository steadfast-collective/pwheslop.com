<h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2">Macro vs Micro Tasks</h1>
<p class="text-xs mb-6">March 2nd, 2022</p>

<div class="prose">
    <p>As a business owner, you&#039;re switching between macro and micro tasks throughout the day, it&#039;s exhausting. You can be planning budgets for the next year when the phone rings about a very specific micro issue.</p><p>It&#039;s constant zooming in and back out again. </p><p>So, what can you do about it?</p><p>I have no magic answer, however, I do have a couple of ideas. </p><p><img src="/assets/Steadfast-68.jpg" alt=""></p><h3>Time blocking</h3><p>Twice a week I have an afternoon blocked out where, in theory, my attention is only on &#039;big picture ideas. I tend to close my email, slack and put my headphones on.</p><h3>Better to-do lists</h3><p>A to-do with the item &#039;Plan Q3&#039; is just terrifying. I don&#039;t know about you, but I have to break down tasks like this. I use physical posit notes to keep track of this month&#039;s macro tasks, and then a to-do list to break those down into tasks that should take no longer than 2 hours. </p><p>Macro: Improve our portfolio.</p><p>Micro: Review current portfolio, write a new piece, produce new graphics, create a video, plan release, etc. </p><h3>Working Hours</h3><p>I&#039;m no early bird, but I tend to find I get my best macro work completed in the early hours of the morning, or late at night. Why? Nobody else is online. As a business, we try to ensure our processes are asynchronous, and in theory, disturbances should be at a minimum... but it&#039;s not so simple in practice.</p>
