    <p>We&#039;re making some changes at Steadfast Collective.</p><p>Over the past few months, we&#039;ve spent time looking back over our six years as a company, looking ahead to the future and we&#039;re ready to make a change to our trajectory, to tweak our course to better align with the values and dreams we have as a business.</p><p><img src="/assets/Steadfast-2020-77.jpg" alt=""></p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>Our &#039;why&#039; has always been to build the best digital products we can. We&#039;ve always wanted to be building applications that change industries, and through hard work over the last few years, <a href="https://steadfastcollective.com/work/vet-help-direct/">we</a> <a href="https://steadfastcollective.com/work/golden-suite/">have</a>.</p><p>That desire to build the best digital products hasn&#039;t changed, but it has evolved.</p><p>When we looked back over the many projects from previous years, the ones which made the biggest social and economic impact are those which are community-focused. </p><p>Applications centred around people and their experiences.</p><p>Projects led by incredibly smart individuals whose passion for people has led them to build communities like no other.</p><p>Your customers are your community. More so than ever people want to be a part of something they believe in and buy from a company whose values align with their own. We want to partner with people who see the value in their community and are ruthless in supporting them. </p><p>Our clients are building communities in their stores, around their software and in their e-learning platforms, among other places. </p><p>At Steadfast Collective, we are driven to have a positive impact outside our immediate ‘four walls’. If we don’t, then why do we exist? </p><p>It’s communities that push the world forward, and we want to help them. That’s why we run events like CXB, make insightful videos, run community giveaways, and push to create the best products we can for our clients and their communities.</p><p><strong>So, what does Steadfast Collective look like now?</strong></p><blockquote><p>We are Steadfast Collective.</p><p></p><p>We exist to craft community-driven digital applications.</p><p></p><p>We are a small team of smart creatives, innovative and adaptable, we are excited by technology and the future we can create online.</p><p></p><p>Our web applications resource communities, grow businesses and create value (both economic and social).</p><p></p><p>We know what it takes to ship, market and scale products and apply this wealth of background knowledge and experience to everything we do.</p><p></p><p>Together we build, grow and scale digital products.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Our focus is shifting to specialising in community-driven digital products.</p><p>Whether it’s a website or app for local business owners, online communities of hobbyists, e-learning platforms for communities of people looking to learn and grow - we want everything we do at Steadfast Collective to benefit people.</p><p>We&#039;re excited to show you what we&#039;re working on.</p><p>Pete</p><p></p><p>Without the team of smart-creatives who are all wonderful and gifted at Steadfast Collective this change wouldn&#039;t be possible. The teamwork tirelessly to ensure we&#039;re building products that leave the internet in a better place than we found it every day. </p><p></p>
