<div class="prose">
    <p>Over the past three months, I’ve had over 30 coffee dates - over Zoom of course. </p><p>Around half the people I chatted with I already knew, the other half were strangers - aside from a little LinkedIn digging, I did not know them.</p><p>I reached out through LinkedIn messages and shared a public link to my calendar in social posts, set aside 30 minutes for each date and drunk copious amounts of coffee. </p><p><img src="/assets/1613574852159.png" alt=""></p><p>Everyone had a different story to tell, <em>however</em> there were a few correlations worth sharing:</p><p><strong>1) People are tired. </strong></p><p>As we creep up to the year’s anniversary of the dreaded Covid-19 initial lockdown, many folks are mentally and physically exhausted. </p><p>That’s understandable, right? </p><p>As soon as Boris Johnson uttered the words ‘Lockdown’ many business owners started sprinting (and have been ever since).</p><p><strong>2) Survival is to be celebrated.</strong></p><p>A surprisingly high number of people I spoke to smashed their 2020 business targets, which is of-course an incredible effort. </p><p>There was also a good chunk of people who were simply celebrating still being here.  </p><p>For most small businesses, being able to make payroll, stay afloat and support their clients during dire times was enough of a cause for celebration. </p><p><strong>3) There is hope.</strong></p><p>Nearly every person I spoke to was optimistic about 2021; excited to meet their team for a BBQ, hug their mum, and move forward. </p><p>For many, the last 12 months have helped shape and mould their businesses into streamlined rockets ready for take-off.</p><blockquote><p>30 people. 30 stories.
