<p class="text-xs mb-6">March 7th, 2022</p>

<div class="prose">
    <p>A while ago someone told me about the concept of &#039;The Value Bank&#039;. I can&#039;t remember who or when I first heard about it, but here&#039;s the gist...</p><p>You need more credit in &#039;The Value Bank&#039;, before you make a withdrawal with your audience.</p><p><img src="/assets/IMG_0119.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Let&#039;s say you&#039;re building a community on Twitter, what value can you give them?</p><p>Perhaps some insights, an educational video or even entertainment. Every time you provide your audience with value, you deposit into this metaphorical shared bank.</p><p>Over time you&#039;ll build up credit (goodwill). Your audience will start to see you as someone who gives, perhaps an expert in their field.</p><p>At some point you might want to make a withdrawal from the bank, this could look like... selling your services, asking for referrals or signing up for your newsletter.</p><p>Making a withdrawal without first depositing into the bank is likely to fall flat, but ask an engaged community who feel as if they&#039;ve been enjoying the fruits of your labour for years and that&#039;s another story.</p>
