    <p>On Thursday, I headed to London with a coffee, a book and my Laptop.</p><p>The reason for my visit? To meet with other agency owners and hear about the statistics in the latest BenchPress report.</p><p>BenchPress is a yearly report, now in its 10th year, which takes data from agencies across the UK to help take the temperature of the landscape.</p><p><img src="/assets/IMG_1572-min-1648207739.gif" alt=""></p><p>I tweeted the event here; <a href="https://twitter.com/Pwheslop/status/1507079391230189581">https://twitter.com/Pwheslop/status/1507079391230189581</a> but here&#039;s what stuck out. </p><p><strong>1) Agency confidence is higher than ever.</strong></p><p>When asked how confident you feel about the year ahead out 100, the average score was 74. </p><p>Aligned with this, 70% of agencies under £1m turnover grew their fee income in 2021, up from 49% in 2020.</p><p><strong>2) Agencies that measure more often are higher performing.</strong></p><p>Statistically, those who measure statistics around their growth and profitability are higher performing. </p><p>This makes sense, right? You can&#039;t build a business on last year&#039;s data. </p><p><strong>3) What do agency owners think is most important...</strong></p><p>Out of money, time, creating an asset and purpose, only 18% of owners listed money as the most important, with 29% giving purpose the top spot.</p><p>What I like about this is that during the report, it was noted that agencies &#039;who do good&#039; get better results, and their owners earn more money than those who don&#039;t. </p><p>We changed our priorities recently, and we&#039;re in a better place because of it <a href="https://pwheslop.com/it-s-time-to-reorder-our-business-goals">https://pwheslop.com/it-s-time-to-reorder-our-business-goals</a></p><blockquote><p>Peter Drucker - Profit for a company is like oxygen for a person. You&#039;re out of the game if you don&#039;t have enough of it. But if you think your life is about breathing, you&#039;re really missing something.</p></blockquote><p>A big thank you to Wow for putting together <a href="https://www.thewowcompany.com/agencies/building-a-profitable-and-sustainable-agency">BenchPress</a>. As an agency owner, it&#039;s a super important report and every year gives us something to think about. </p>
