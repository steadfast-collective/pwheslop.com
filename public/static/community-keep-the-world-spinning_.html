    <p>Over at Steadfast Collective, we talk about the concept of community a lot.</p><p>There are different reasons why the team champion the idea of community, but for me, it&#039;s simple.</p><p>Community keep the world spinning.</p><p>Community: People with common interests, history, social or economic background.</p><p>There&#039;s something extraordinary about being part of a collective of people with a common interest or cause. </p><p>A football game, protest or parenting group all have people coming together to achieve something.</p><p>What we&#039;re trying to achieve doesn&#039;t have to be bold or grand.</p><p><img src="/assets/IMG_9475.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I attend a Dads group once a month, where we get together, eat bacon rolls and play with our children. This community, to me, is a safe place for me to spend quality time with my two-year-old, enjoying her play with toddlers. </p><p>This community doesn&#039;t change the world, but it changes ours.</p>
