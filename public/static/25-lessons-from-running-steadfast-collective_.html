    <p>[This post originally posted on Linked in in <em>2020</em>]</p><p><strong>Back in May <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Steadfast Collective</a> turned 5 years old.</strong></p><p>These are my personal thoughts on the crucial lessons I&#039;ve learnt over the last five years of running Steadfast Collective; a development studio.</p><p>1. Start with your why. Running any business is hard; know your why.</p><p>2. Have an excellent co-founder to help share the stress.</p><p>3. Build your support network to include those with experience.</p><p>4. Be open and transparent with everyone.</p><p>5. Having the right team on the bus will get you 80% of the way there.</p><p>6. Other agencies aren&#039;t the enemy; they&#039;re allies.</p><p>7. Hiring is hard.  </p><p>8. Having better client legal processes in place is freeing, not restrictive.</p><p>9. Burnout is real, and it takes time to recover.</p><p>10. Culture isn&#039;t beanbags and beer; it&#039;s trust and purpose.</p><p>11. The feeling of winning new work is great.</p><p>12. The feeling of delivering work is better.</p><p>13. When setting a new policy, give it a timeframe so you can test and revert.</p><p>14. Most clients would rather you over-communicate. </p><p>15. As the MD, you have the ability to be the most disruptive member of your team.</p><p>16. Know your teams&#039; strengths and weaknesses. </p><p>17. People will always pay late. Don&#039;t expect your cashflow forecast ever to be 100% correct.</p><p>18. Generating leads is hard. We have a story, and we tell it through various content.</p><p>19. Thank those who refer work to you.</p><p>20. Keep in touch with that network. Be thoughtful; send cards, emails and book regular calls.</p><p>21. Hire an accountant.</p><p>22. Even if you&#039;re using Xero, hire an accountant.</p><p>23. Know which work not to take on.</p><p>24. Removing yourself (as the MD) from &#039;production&#039; work allows you to grow. </p><p>25. Trust your instinct. </p>
