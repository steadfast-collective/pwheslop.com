    <p>You may have heard; we ran another <a target="_blank" href="https://steadfastcollective.com/giveaway/">website giveaway</a>.</p><p>Back in 2019, we ran a similar giveaway, and the winner was the <a target="_blank" href="https://qe2activitycentre.co.uk/">QE2 Activity Centre</a>. Once chosen, we had a chance to view their activity centre, and we were blown away by the inclusive haven they have created.</p><p>We have tallied up the votes and are excited to announce that the winner of a new website is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zoes-place.org.uk/">Zoë&#039;s Place Baby Hospice</a>.</p><p>Zoë&#039;s Place Baby Hospice provides specialist end-of-life, palliative, and respite care for children aged 0-5 with life-limiting and life-threatening conditions. They provide 24-hour, one-to-one individualised care for each child. </p><p>As part of our change in trajectory, we set goals for 2021, 2023 and 2025 around the following areas; stability, revenue, ventures, brand, community, team, education, client success and technology. We&#039;ve set epic big picture goals for 2023 and 2025, while 2021 has smart targets with clear stepping stones.</p><p>There are two reasons we&#039;ve set these targets;</p><p>1) To bring clarity</p><p>2) To keep us accountable</p><p>Steadfast Collective exists to serve more than just its shareholders and its clients, and we should have a social and economic impact throughout our various touch-points.</p><p>As a business, we have an opportunity to have a positive real-world impact, arguably more so than a person alone.</p><p>That&#039;s why we&#039;re giving away a website to a business, charity or organisation; we want to use our resources and skills to improve the lives of others.</p>
