<div class="prose">
    <p>Hi, I&#039;m Pete, Managing Director at Steadfast Collective, my passion is working with smart creatives to craft digital applications that bring people together.</p><p>The last 10 years have seen me go from a developer on a website with over 13 million members to starting, growing and selling an agency, building a SAAS with over 13,000 users and then starting Steadfast Collective, a development agency focused on helping communities gather online.</p><p>I&#039;ve had the privilege of speaking at various events around the UK, to both technical and non-technical audiences, sharing my story, experiences and lessons along the way.</p><p><strong>If you&#039;d be interested in me speaking at your event, reach out at pete@steadfastcollective.com</strong></p><p><img src="/assets/CXBFeb2020-28.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I&#039;m happy to talk about everything from leadership to product development and everything in between. </p><p>Here&#039;s a sample of the talks I&#039;ve given previously.</p><h2>Tap: the journey to 13,000 users.</h2><p>Tap entered the already overcrowded WordPress hosting space in 2013, with a team who knew little about server-management, back-end development, or how to market a SAAS.</p><p>Eight years later, Tap is now established in the managed WordPress hosting sector, having seen over 13,000 websites created. But how did we get there?</p><p>As a founder, I share my insights and war stories on building a product more ambitious than any of us ever realised.</p><p>A deep dive into many make-or-break moments as we juggled running a full-time agency and a full-time product before moving onto our playbook for growth and our automated future.</p><h2>The Smart Creatives</h2><p>Google&#039;s &#039;How it works&#039; by Eric Schmidt describes a &#039;smart creative&#039; as a person that doesn&#039;t chase compensation; they pursue the ability to cause change and disrupt industries.</p><p>Through my experience of founding and running three digital businesses over eight years, I have discovered that a critical element relating to the growth and success of the companies has been working with smart creatives. Teams thrive when these questioning and focused generalists catch the vision and run with it.</p><p>I share my experience of switching your thinking to become more &#039;smart creative&#039; and explore how to spot and then grow smart creatives to their full potential.</p><h2>Community First. Product Second.</h2><p>1,000s of applications and products launch daily, most fail. </p><p>How do you ensure yours doesn&#039;t?</p><p>Building a community around your idea before you start building is possibly the most important decision you can make when launching something new.</p><p>I look at the how and why, behind building a community, sharing stories of when products succeeded and failed based on the strength of the community around it.</p><h2>Your first 100 customers.</h2><p>Acquiring your first 100 customers will always be the hardest. </p><p>I open our playbook and share lessons from successful and not so successful product launches from over the last 10 years.</p><p>I&#039;ve distilled all those learnings into our strategy for acquiring your first 100 customers.</p>
