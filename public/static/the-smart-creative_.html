    <p>Based on a study of 101 post-mortems, 23% of them concluded that the primary reason behind their startup’s demise did not have the right team.</p><p>That was the third-highest behind, no market need and ran out of money.</p><p><img src="/assets/Steadfast-2020-29.jpg" alt=""><strong>So, what do we look for at Steadfast Collective?</strong></p><p>We look for Smart Creatives.</p><p>Here’s how Google defines a Smart Creative:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>A person that doesn’t chase compensation; they pursue the ability to cause change and disrupt industries.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>When you dig a little into their book, How Google Works, they expand on this.</p><ul><li><p>A smart creative has technical knowledge of their trade, hands-on experience, an expert in their field.</p></li><li><p>They’re analytically smart.</p></li><li><p>They’re always referring to data to drive home a point.</p></li><li><p>Quick to iterate on their ideas and flex to the data’s results.</p></li><li><p>They create technical solutions to business problems. They understand the user and what the user wants. They don’t design and build for their ego; they look at the business case and user feedback.</p></li><li><p>They’re a firehose of new ideas which are actually good.</p></li><li><p>Often hard to manage.</p></li><li><p>They’re the person in the meeting who are often frustrated because they’ve already come up with a solution before the agenda is read out.</p></li><li><p>Self-directed, they don’t like to be micro-managed although happy to collaborate and can articulate ideas to team members.</p></li></ul><p> </p><p>When thinking through the ideology around Smart Creatives here was how I summarised the traits:</p><ul><li><p>Technically</p></li><li><p>Driven</p></li><li><p>Business</p></li></ul><p>A smart creative is someone who is <strong>technically</strong> able to do their work, Michael Gerber in his book The E-Myth, would use the phrasing Technician.</p><p>As part of this technical mindset, they care about the data surrounding their tasks and role. They’re not going to jump into a task without first analysing the facts.</p><p>A Smart Creative isn’t only technically gifted; they’re <strong>driven</strong>, self-motivated, hands-on and able to articulate.</p><p>One of the key differences between a person who is solely technically gifted and a Smart Creative is that a Smart Creative is able to articulate their ideas and processes to other team members, often making them excellent at delegation and leading teams.</p><p>Finally, a Smart Creative has a hybrid mindset; Creative and <strong>Business</strong>. Everything they work on has to help the business, and they’ll be creative in achieving those tasks.</p><p>This means the Smart Creative is often results-focused, full of ideas and interested in success outside of their silo.</p><p><br></p>
