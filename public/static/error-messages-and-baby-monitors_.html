    <p>At home, we have recently had a few WIFI-related struggles. </p><p>I made a few changes, which, unknown to me, caused our baby monitor set up to fail. In theory, it should have still worked. </p><p>We hit issues like this in product development all the time. </p><p>You restart a server, merge in small change or update a package, and what was a simple, risk-less task causes a knock-on issue or, worse, downtime. </p><p>Technology should be built to successfully fail, but more often than not, it isn&#039;t. As developers, we owe it to our consumers to ensure that it does so gracefully and informatively when our work fails. </p><p><strong>As designers</strong>, we should be ensuring as default that we are designing error states and flows for unexpected failures. </p><p><strong>As product owners,</strong> we need to plan user journeys for failed actions, and set aside a budget to ensure we are ready to adapt, rather than being in a state of &#039;add this to the future list&#039;. </p><p>As for our baby monitor, we&#039;re currently using a Neos Smartcam. </p><p><img src="/assets/IMG_0582.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I would not recommend this. </p><p>If you&#039;re in the market, I would look for something entirely isolated from your home internet, which works instantly when you switch it on. </p><p>The frustration from an app crashing at 2 am while you&#039;re trying to settle your toddler is not worth the benefits.</p>
