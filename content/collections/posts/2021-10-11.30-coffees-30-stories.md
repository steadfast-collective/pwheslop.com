title: '30 Coffees. 30 Stories.'
summary: |-
  Over the past three months, I’ve had over 30 coffee dates - over Zoom of course. 

  Around half the people I chatted with I already knew, the other half were strangers - aside from a little LinkedIn digging, I did not know them.

  I reached out through LinkedIn messages and shared a public link to my calendar in social posts, set aside 30 minutes for each date and drunk copious amounts of coffee.
