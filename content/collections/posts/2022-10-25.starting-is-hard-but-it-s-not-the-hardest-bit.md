title: 'Starting is hard. (But it''s not the hardest bit)'
summary: |-
  Starting a business is hard.

  There are so many possible directions you can take.

  It's full of risk, disappointment and graft.

  Only 40% of UK businesses make it past year three.

  Starting is only the beginning - it gets harder.
