I have been working in digital for just over nine years, continuing my interest in web development, which he kindled in his early teens.

Managing Director at Steadfast Collective, my key focus is on building a team of smart creatives which build industry-changing web-applications. I also founded and run a SAAS, Tap, which is the easiest WordPress hosting youâ€™ll ever use.
